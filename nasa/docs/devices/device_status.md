# Field Documentation: `device_status`

## 1. Possible Status Values

The `device_status` field tracks the current operational condition of a device within the NASA mission ecosystem. It supports the following values:

- **faulty**: The device is experiencing critical issues and requires immediate attention.
- **killed**: The device has been deliberately shut down or terminated due to unrecoverable faults or planned deactivation.
- **unknown**: The current status of the device cannot be determined due to data loss or signal interference.
- **warning**: The device is operational but has registered conditions that may require investigation.
- **good**: The device is functioning within expected parameters.
- **excellent**: The device is performing optimally with no anomalies detected.

## 2. Why Should This Be Monitored?

Monitoring the `device_status` field is essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of mission-critical components. Early detection of problems through status changes allows:

- Prevention of mission failure
- Proactive maintenance and support
- Better allocation of resources and personnel
- Real-time response to emergencies

## 3. How It Supports Space Travel

In space missions, even minor malfunctions can have major consequences. By actively tracking device status:

- Engineers can isolate and mitigate faults before escalation.
- Astronauts are informed in real time about equipment conditions.
- Data scientists can build predictive models to foresee failures.

This contributes to mission longevity, astronaut safety, and optimal use of limited on-board systems.

## 4. Scientific Context and Illustrations

### Speed of Light Formula

In understanding signal transmission delays and timing diagnostics from remote space devices, the speed of light is a critical constraint:


$$
c = 299,792,458\ \text{m/s}
$$

Where:

- ( $c$ ) is the speed of light in a vacuum

This helps in calculating communication delays:
$$
t = \frac{d}{c}
$$
Where:

- $( t )$: time delay
- $( d )$: distance from the device
- $( c )$: speed of light

### Device Signal Reliability Model

A simplified reliability function over time:

$$
R(t) = e^{-\lambda t}
$$

Where:

- $R(t)$ : probability the device is still functioning at time $(t)$
- $(lambda)$: failure rate constant

### Example Devices

Here are a few types of devices that report `device_status`:

- Satellite transponders
- Onboard telemetry modules
- Environmental sensors
- Navigation and guidance units

## 5. Why This Field Matters

The `device_status` field is a cornerstone of system diagnostics in space missions. It encapsulates operational health in a compact, analyzable way. Reliable interpretation of this field enables:

- Safer missions
- Better system designs
- Insightful data-driven decisions

In short, itâ€™s a small field with a huge impact.event_type
