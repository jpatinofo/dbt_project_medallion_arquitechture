# Welcome to the Space Missions Monitoring Project â€“ NASA

The **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)** is the United States government agency responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research.

Today, NASA is entering a new era of exploration, innovation, and global inspiration. To reclaim its historic leadership in space and push the boundaries of what's possible, the agency has launched four of its most ambitious missions to date:

-**OrbitOne (ORBONE):** Modernizing the satellite fleet to enhance performance, coverage, and communications.
-**ColonyMoon (CLNM):** Establishing a permanent lunar colony.
-**VacMars (TMRS):** Beginning manned tourist travel to Mars.
-**GalaxyOne (GALXONE):** A long-term project to explore galaxies beyond our own.

These groundbreaking initiatives rely on cutting-edge technologies and have captured international attention. Given the scale and complexity of these missions, NASA has developed a unified monitoring system that transmits operational data **every 20 seconds**. This system is designed to provide real-time insights into the status of satellites, spacecraft, vehicles, and other mission-critical assets.

Its core objective is to detect anomalies early and enable proactive measures to protect both missions and the safety of astronauts and space tourists.

## Your Role

Due to the importance of this effort, you have been selected as the **Chief Engineer and Expert in Big Data & Analytics**. Your mission:  
**Travel to Cape Canaveral and lead the initial simulation of the monitoring system before it goes live.**

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to one of the most significant technological challenges of our time. Your expertise will be vital in ensuring mission success and setting the foundation for the future of space exploration.

### What to Expect

Throughout this simulation, you will:

- Handle real-time telemetry and operational logs.
- Detect and document potential anomalies.
- Validate data pipelines and ensure system robustness.
- Collaborate with engineers, analysts, and mission control.

This project will test not only your technical skills but your ability to lead, analyze, and adapt under dynamic conditions.
